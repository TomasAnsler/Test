The world around us is filled with countless phenomena, each governed by its own unique set of rules.
 We often perceive these occurrences as self-evident, without considering the complex processes and 
interconnections that lie beneath their surface. Knowledge and understanding of these processes enable 
us not only to comprehend the world but also to change it, improve it, create new technologies, and reach 
new heights in both science and everyday life.
