medical science, each step forward opens new doors of possibility. However, every discovery comes with 
its own set of challenges, pushing us to rethink our approaches and refine our understanding. It is 
this constant pursuit of knowledge and improvement that fuels innovation and creates a brighter future 
for generations to come.
